# Image Management Library - CMS

This is an image management library that you can use to save images in a /folder/year/month/date format for better cleaning, management etc like in Wordpress. Also included is resizing using Intervention Library. I found it useful and i hope it can benefit someone out there. 

Built using Laravel 5.3.

Uploads are set in the Helpers/FileUploads.php file.
